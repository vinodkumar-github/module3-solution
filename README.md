# module3-solution
My Project Work Assignment to make a web application for given specifications using  twitter bootstrap.
Please dont copy or use my code under any circumstances.
I really worked hard and wrote every single line of this module-3 assignment by even reading each class definitions in bootstrap. 
I am still a beginner in this and so really am cherishing whatever original code I am writing.
