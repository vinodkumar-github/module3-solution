This repository contains my solution to Project Work Assignment I was posed with where I needed to make a web application for given specifications using  twitter bootstrap.
Please dont copy this work. Feel free to go through the comments to see my approach.
I am still a beginner in this. There are many areas where this code can be simplified or made even better. 
This is  Particularly valid with regard to the styles.css file in css folder.

Ciao!
